*The music we learn is practical. I have been mapping the practical aspects (such as octaves and scales) to mathematical concepts (such as fourier transformation, reverberation, interference and resonance, overtones, superposition and beats, timbre and many more). It has been fun but nothing close to writing a monograph or creating tools and visualizations. Enjoy the poem below, till I make significant strides worth publishing.*
