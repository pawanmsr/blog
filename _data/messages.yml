    Hi, I am Pawan - an overtly curious oddball that enjoys building and making.
    I often write, and sometimes share them here - mostly getaway articles
    depicting my most obtrusive thoughts (that are unrelated to professional or personal)
    in the form of poetry and humour, along with occasional explorations in my fields of study
    - largely in Physics, but also in other STEM disciplines that I enjoy.
